== Description ==
Discover information about about all post types registered for a site. Information about post types is displayed in the admin Dashboard and in the List Post Data admin page (LPD).

The shortcode [lpd] can be used to display post data in any page or post. Table rows can be clicked to make the deep data box sticky.

Information about post types is displayed in a summary table which shows the Menu Label, Internal Name, Single Item Name and whether or not the post type is internal (i.e. custom post type or not).

Hovering over a table row presents more in-depth information about the selected post type. This information is presented in a data box. Data boxes can clicked to make them sticky and then dragged around the screen.
